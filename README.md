- Assuming you've got multiple crash reports and reviews saying the app is not working properly and is slow for specific models, 
what would be your strategy to tackle the problem?

I will get the logs from the administrative panel of the store where the application is inserted, analyze them by impact level, and do the 
resolutions in phases, sending new versions according to the resolution of the problems.

- Assuming your app has now thousands of users thus a lot of posts to show in the feed. What do you believe should be improved 
in this initial version and what strategies/proposals you could formulate for such a challenge?

I will create a view post limiter and as the user views posts, the system will show new posts on demand. Right after that, I will create 
a mechanism between users, where the user can follow people, then I will show only posts related to the people the user is following.
